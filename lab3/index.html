			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was to create and organize a local file structure and add html files in a
					manner that is easy to navigate.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We did not encounter any major problems outside of Ben's Github having some strange popups that we
					had never encountered before. We were able to solve them by talking to Ilia and asking other peers
					with coding experience.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>We felt that this assignment was relatively straightforward and was more an organization focused
					assignment rather than a strictly coding based one. The effort we put in was mostly around going
					back and c hecking our work and making sure we didn't have any silly mistakes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results we felt were pretty smooth, as you can see, the fruits of our labors involve this page
					and the functioning links and images it has. Below is a screenshot of the code for my homepage.</p>
