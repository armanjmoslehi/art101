                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>We were a little worried coming out of the last lecture because we were a bit lost, but after
                    reviewing the slides, the video recording, and the work we did in class, we felt much more
                    comfortable with the work we had to do for this lab.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This felt like the first time we really had to mess around with the code a couple times to understand
                    what the heck was going on. But it felt good to figure it out!</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Results</h2>
