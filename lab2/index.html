			<h1>Lab 2 - Ben and Arman</h1>
			<p>Hey there! I'm Arman, working with Ben as my lab partner! Ben and I are both art majors and we share a
				class together outside of this one, Landscape Drawing. Both Ben and I love Donkey Kong, digital art, and
				rock climbing. We're excited to make some cool projects in this class and expand our field of what art
				can be!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this Lab was getting comfortable with writing HTML and CSS code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Most of our problems were from remembering small yet important parts of the process, such as opening
					the right file or remembering to save our work. Ben and I also had very busy schedules during this
					lab, so we had to really communicate to find time to pair program together. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment was really intimidating at first but the more we got used to not only using VSC and
					GitHub but also just seeing it, they became more comfortable for us and less scary. We both spent a
					good amount of time using our notes from class and W3 to refresh what tags we needed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>We succeeded in making and customizing a webpage using HTML and CSS respectively.</p>
